
EXCEPTION HANDLING :-
When there is an exception, the developer does not want interpution or disturbance in the program flow. To achieve this we are using exception handling.

a=1000
b=0
try:
    print(a/b)
#except Exception:#u saying if error there i handle
#print ("Cant divide any number by zero")

except Exception as e:
    print("Please note, number cant be divided by zero",e)#this will print error also

#To check your programme execution goes till the end or get stops
    print ("Bye")
o/p:-
Please note, number cant be divided by zero division by zero
Bye

OOPS :-
It is an efficient concept used in all programming concepts like java and python. For multiple reasons we use oops concept for example code reuseability , data security, hiding data.
i)Class:-
its a blue print example birds,laptops.
ii)Object:-
Its a thing created based on class.

Note:-
One class can have multiple objects.
Example:-Birds is a class, parrot, peacock, dock are objects.
Example:Class is a laptop, and lenova,hp,dell are objects.
